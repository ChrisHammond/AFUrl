Active Forums URL Provider for URLMaster

*NO LONGER MAINTAINED* you should be on DNN 9 now, URLMaster is useless now.

This project consists of a Module Provider for URL master that will redirect old DotNetNuke Forum (module) URLs to a new ActiveForum URL.

It is for use after you've configured your ActiveForum and also ran the conversion script that ActiveForum provides for the module conversion.

It requires a URLMaster license and URLMaster to be enabled to use.
